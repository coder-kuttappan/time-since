**Track when you last did something. That's it.**

Time Since is not a habit tracker. It's not a to-do list. It doesn't set goals, count streaks, or tell you you've failed.

It answers one question: *when did I last do this?*

## Why this exists

Most habit apps are designed around streaks, goals, and accountability. Break a streak and you see red. Miss a day and the app reminds you. For a lot of people — especially those with ADHD, depression, or just chaotic lives — this creates shame spirals, not motivation.

Time Since takes the opposite approach:

- **No streaks.** No goals. No reminders. No red.
- **Purely backward-looking.** It just shows you how long it's been.
- **No failure states.** There's nothing to break, nothing to miss.
- **One tap to log.** Tap "did it again" and move on.

Changed your bedsheets 3 weeks ago? That's not a failure. That's just information. Do with it what you will.

## How it works

1. Type what you want to track ("Changed bedsheets", "Called Mom", "Went to the dentist")
2. It shows you how long ago that was
3. When you do it again, tap the card and hit "did it again"
4. That's it. There is no step 4.

## Features

- **Tap to expand** — cards show just the name and time. Tap to see actions and history.
- **Edit anything** — tap the time to change the date, tap the name to rename.
- **History log** — every "did it again" is recorded so you can see patterns over time.
- **Auto-scaling time** — shows "just now", "3 hours", "4 days", "2w 3d", "3 months", "1.2 years" depending on how long it's been.
- **Export/import** — download your data as JSON. Restore anytime.
- **Installable PWA** — add to your home screen, works offline, data stays on your device.
- **No account required** — everything lives in your browser's local storage. Your data never leaves your phone.

## Privacy

Your data stays on your device. There is no server, no database, no analytics, no tracking. The app runs entirely in your browser. Export gives you a JSON file — that's the only way data leaves.
